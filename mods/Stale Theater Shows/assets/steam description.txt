[h3]Details[/h3]
- Theater show sales and subscriptions start to decay after 30 days since the last single due to staleness. It's not so severe in easy/normal mode, but more severe in Unfair.
- Theater subscription revenue decreased by 70% in Normal mode and 90% in Unfair mode. Most of the revenue goes to the streaming service provider.
- Theater attendance for Manzais halved to scale with stamina cost compared to performances.
- Theater attendance increased when the show targets 'everyone', 'casual' or specific age groups to be balanced.
