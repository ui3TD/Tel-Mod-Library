[h3]Save File Editing[/h3]
This mod writes the MBTI to the "Variables" parameter of each girl in the save file. To edit the MBTI find the "Variables" parameter. It should look like something this:
[code]"Variables": [
    "ENFJ"
],[/code]

The old _mbti.json files are now obsolete and are safe to delete.

[h3]Unique Idols[/h3]
You can make unique idols have a specific MBTI type by adding a line in params.json like so:
"mbti": "INTJ"
