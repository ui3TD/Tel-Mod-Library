Idols will demand fair wages! Brand new staff cannot be blamed for scandals!

[h3]Idol Salaries[/h3]
- 20000 yen/wk is the expected starting salary for 100% satisfaction.
- 20000 yen/wk is the default starting salary.
- In Unfair, idols at 10 fame will expect at least 10% of their earnings as salary so that the endgame is more challenging.
- In Unfair and Normal mode, penalty for low salary satisfaction increased 10x. Each day, if satisfaction gets under 50%, the graduation date moves closer by 10 days. If under 20% then 30 days.

[h3]Staff Rights[/h3]
- Staff cannot be fired using scandal points within the first month so that you can't just hire and immediately fire staff to get rid of points.
