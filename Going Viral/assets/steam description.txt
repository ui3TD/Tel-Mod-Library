[h3]How to Trigger Trending[/h3]
- When a single's marketing critically succeeds, there is a chance of trending. This chance increases with the popularity of the genre, choreo and lyrics on the charts. Keep track of the trending genres to maximize your chances!
- When a TV show is released, there is a chance of trending after the first week. This chance increases with the number of days since the launch of a tv show with the same genre. Mix up your TV show genres to maximize your chances!
- When a single's marketing critically fails, there is a chance of getting negative press and a trending penalty (only if you're using the Fan Attrition mod).
- When you get a scandal point, there is a chance of getting negative press and a trending penalty (only if you're using the Fan Attrition mod).

[h3]Effects of Trending[/h3]
- When you're trending, all singles, shows, business proposals and tours get a multiplier to the total number of new fans. These new fans will be mainly casual fans.
- When you're negatively trending, a multiplier is added to fan churn as a penalty (only if you're using the Fan Attrition mod).
