Unlimited sister groups, but they are nerfed to maintain balance.

- Sister group minimum member limit for creation removed to allow more freedom.
- When releasing a single, the penalty for a decrease in fame and appeal now only considers past singles of the same group, so that sister groups are more independent.
- In Unfair, sister group new fans are reduced 5x to balance out the increased number of sister groups.
- In Unfair, sister group new fans are reduced if the group has less than 10 members. If there is 1 member, then you only get 10% new fans, if 2 members, then 20% etc. This is because having tons of groups with 1 member each becomes really overpowered.
